# Python Assignment

## Question 1: Convert Integer Values to Indian Currency Notation

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python code to convert integer values to Indian currency notations without using any currency libraries.

**Example**:
- Input: `504678`
- Output: `5,04,678`



# Question 2 : Python Assignment: Minimum Players to Be Shot

## Problem Statement:
Gi-Hun and Ali have the same height, and Gi-Hun is trying to hide behind Ali to avoid getting shot. There are several players standing between them. Gi-Hun wants to know how many players need to be shot so that Ali becomes visible in his line of sight.

### Conditions:
- Ali is visible to Gi-Hun if nobody between them has a height greater than both Gi-Hun and Ali.
- Even if some players are of the same height as Gi-Hun and Ali, they won't obstruct the view.

### Input Format:
- The first line of input contains a single integer `T` — the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains two space-separated integers `N` and `K` — the number of players between Gi-Hun and Ali, and the height of both Gi-Hun and Ali, respectively.
  - The second line contains `N` space-separated integers representing the heights of the players between Gi-Hun and Ali.

### Output Format:
For each test case, output the minimum number of players that need to be shot so that Ali is visible to Gi-Hun.

### Constraints:
- \( 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq K \leq 10^6 \)
- \( 1 \leq H_i \leq 10^6 \) for every \( 1 \leq i \leq N \)
- The sum of \( N \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 5 \times 10^5 \)
